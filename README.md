# **Drum Kit Application**

## **Overview**

The Drum Kit Application is an interactive web application that allows users to play different drum sounds by either clicking on virtual drum buttons or pressing the corresponding keys on their keyboard. The application is built using JavaScript and incorporates event listeners to handle user interactions and play the drum sounds.

## **How to Use**

1. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

2. You will see a set of drum buttons on the screen, each representing a different drum sound.

3. To play a drum sound, either:

    * Click on the corresponding drum button using your mouse.
    * Press the key associated with the drum sound on your keyboard. The key mapping is as follows:
        * "w" - Tom 1 sound
        * "a" - Tom 2 sound
        * "s" - Tom 3 sound
        * "d" - Tom 4 sound
        * "j" - Crash cymbal sound
        * "k" - Kick bass sound
        * "l" - Snare sound
4. Each time you click a drum button or press a corresponding key, the respective drum sound will be played.

5. Additionally, when a drum sound is played, the corresponding drum button will briefly highlight to provide visual feedback.
